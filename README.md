Course Description
What do Amazon product recommendations and Netflix movie suggestions have in common? They both rely on Market Basket Analysis, which is a powerful tool for translating vast amounts of customer transaction and viewing data into simple rules for product promotion and recommendation. In this course, you’ll learn how to perform Market Basket Analysis using the Apriori algorithm, standard and custom metrics, association rules, aggregation and pruning, and visualization. You’ll then reinforce your new skills through interactive exercises, building recommendations for a small grocery store, a library, an e-book seller, a novelty gift retailer, and a movie streaming service. In the process, you’ll uncover hidden insights to improve recommendations for customers.
